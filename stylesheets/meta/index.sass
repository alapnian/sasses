/// Variables
/// ============================================================
/// Sass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with $, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself.
/// But despite their simplicity, they’re one of the most useful tools Sass brings to the table.
/// ariables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, and much more.
